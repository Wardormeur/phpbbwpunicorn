Bridge for content (user/posts..?) from phpbb 3.1+ to Wordpress
it makes use of the new Symfony 2 events in order to catch the CRUD event of whatever we need
This plugin has been originally done for the website tellementnomade.org

Required : 
Wordpress (tested 4.1)
Phpbb 3.1+

Help/Remarks/Evolutions are up to what you may think of. Be creative and don't restrain yourslef about how i could improve the plugin (aka you code like a pig)

I may refuse some regarding the fact that it will need a wordpress plugin in ordrer to get a full scope of every data : this plugin only treats data from phpbb TO wordpress, and not the opposite. That's gonna be another plugin for WP ;)
